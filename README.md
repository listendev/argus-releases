## Mythology

In Greek mythology, Argus Panoptes, or simply Argus, is a fascinating and
unique character renowned for his hundred eyes. According to myth, Argus
was a giant, an all-seeing guardian, making him an ideal watchman.

His most famous tale involves being appointed by Hera, the queen of the
gods, to guard the white heifer Io, who was actually Zeus' lover
transformed into a cow to escape Hera's wrath. Argus' ability to have some
of his eyes sleep while others remained awake made him a nearly
impenetrable guardian.

Argus' story intertwines themes of vigilance, loyalty, and the intricate
dynamics of the divine in Greek mythology.
